# vscode-arcadia

### Getting Started
To run from source, clone the repo somewhere & open the 
root folder in VSCode.  Run the extension in an 
Extension Development Host by pressing `F5`, or 
clicking `Debug` > `Start`.  This runs the compiled
extension.js file in the root folder.

Ensure Unity is up & an Arcadia project is loaded.
Then in VSCode `âŒ˜-shift-p` and run `Arcadia: REPL - Start`.

Once the REPL is active, you can 
- `Arcadia: REPL - Send Line` (`ctrl+, l`)
- `Arcadia: REPL - Send Selection` (`ctrl+, s`) or
- `Arcadia: REPL - Send File` (`ctrl+, f`) 
to send the current line, selection or file to the
REPL respectively. Note that the extension automatically
activates when VSCode detects current language as Clojure.
So if you have a Clojure file open but no REPL yet, 
you can simply `send` the line/selection/file and 
the REPL will be started for you.  

There is currently no in-REPL editing available, but 
you can open an empty file & use it as a scratch buffer.
The REPL doesn't care what syntax the file is set to, 
but you would need to set it Clojure to get syntax 
highlighting obviously.

### Development 
To make changes or just build fresh from source,
run `lein cljsbuild once` (or `auto` for continuous
compilation);

> NOTE: it took some fiddling to get a ClojureScript
working in a VSCode extension.

>I mostly followed the non-Figwheel parts of 
[this](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Node.js-development-with-figwheel),
but I found that the Google Closure library didn't load 
properly (specifically, provided namespaces got attached 
to `goog.global` but not attached to the global `goog` var).
>
>The trick to get it working was `:optimizations :simple` 
combined with `:output-wrapper true`. The other requirements 
are specifying `:main` and calling `(set! *main-cli-fn* -main)` 
from that namespace as documented on the ClojureScript 
NodeJS wiki page.

To build the .vsix file, install the vsce extension and
use its 'package' subcommand.  The .vsix file can be
installed:

- via VSCode's --install-extension command via
the command line -OR-

- via the 'Install from .VSIX...' menu item in the
'More Actions...' menu in the Extension panel of VSCode's
GUI
